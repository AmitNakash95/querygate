# TODO: QueryGate → production-grade

Action items to take QueryGate from "working, tested prototype" to a
ready-to-ship commercial product. Grouped by priority. Each item explains
*why* it matters, not just what to build — treat the "why" as the acceptance
criteria. Items marked with a file path point at where the current
(incomplete) implementation lives.

Cross-reference: `README.md` → "Current limitations" and
`MIGRATION_REPORT.md` → "What still needs work" cover the same ground more
briefly; this file is the actionable breakdown.

## Effort scale

Rough solo-engineer time, assuming familiarity with this codebase already.
Design + implementation + tests, not just a first draft. Real infra
(databases, cloud accounts) and unfamiliar external systems (JWKS, Vault)
push estimates toward the high end of their range — treat these as
order-of-magnitude, not commitments.

| Size | Time |
|---|---|
| XS | a few hours |
| S | 0.5–1 day |
| M | 2–3 days |
| L | 3–5 days |
| XL | 1–3+ weeks |

## Quick-scan summary

| # | Item | Effort | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|

\* item 14's estimate assumes the Dockerfile mostly works; the MSSQL ODBC
apt-install step is the likeliest place for it to balloon past the estimate
if Microsoft's repo/package layout has drifted.

## P0 — blockers before any production traffic

### 1. Audit logs currently leak filter literals

**Effort: S (0.5–1 day).** Contained to `_compile_to_text`/`audit_query` and
the `explain` response — no new subsystem, just a behavior change plus a
config knob and a test proving values no longer appear in logs.

**Why it matters:** `execution/service.py`'s `_compile_to_text()` tries
`stmt.compile(compile_kwargs={"literal_binds": True})` first, which succeeds
for most queries — meaning the SQL text written to the audit log (and to
`explain_structured_query`'s response) has WHERE-clause *values* baked in as
literals, not `?`/`$1` placeholders. If an agent filters on
`Customer.Email == 'jane@example.com'` or `SSN == '123-45-6789'`, that value
is now sitting in a log line. This directly contradicts the README's "audit
records... never row payloads" claim for anything expressible in a `where`.

**What to do:** Decide the intended behavior — options are (a) always log
parameterized SQL + a separately-redactable params blob, (b) hash/truncate
literal values above some length, or (c) make it configurable per-policy
(some deployments may *want* full literals for debugging). Whatever is
chosen, update the `explain_structured_query` response too, since it has the
same property and is returned directly to the caller.

### 2. MSSQL support is untested against a real server

**Effort: L (3–5 days).** The unknowns are what make this large, not the
code volume: real MSSQL/ODBC driver behavior in an async pool, cross-database
schema qualification, and container/CI setup are all things that only reveal
their problems once you're actually running against a live server. Budget
extra time if this surfaces real bugs in `connections/dialects.py` or
`schema/reflection.py`, which is likely.

**Why it matters:** Goal was "Postgres and MSSQL" as the two supported
dialects, but this environment had no MSSQL server. `connections/dialects.py`
(engine URL building, connect args, session guardrails) and the compiler's
`DATEADD`/`DATEDIFF` date-bucket path are covered by unit tests that check
*generated SQL text*, not by anything that ever executed against SQL Server.
Shipping "MSSQL supported" without ever having run a query against MSSQL is
a real risk (ODBC driver quirks, `pyodbc`/`aioodbc` connection pooling
behavior, and cross-database schema-qualification for `join_group` are all
unverified).

**What to do:** Stand up an MSSQL container (or Azure SQL) in CI, add an
integration test suite mirroring `tests/integration/test_sqlite_end_to_end.py`
but against real MSSQL, and specifically verify: session guardrails
(`SET LOCK_TIMEOUT`, `XACT_ABORT`) actually take effect, cross-database joins
via schema qualification (`connections/engine.py`'s `physical_db_name` +
`schema/reflection.py`'s cross-schema reflection) work end-to-end, and the
`geography`/`geometry`-typed-column ODBC limitation noted in the old
prototype's instructions doesn't silently break `describe_table`.

### 3. Query timeout is a connect-time setting, not a guaranteed cancellation

**Effort: M (1–2 days).** Mostly test-writing against a real Postgres (easy
to provision via `docker compose`); MSSQL half of this rides on item 2's
infra. If the test reveals the guardrail doesn't actually cancel, fixing it
could push this toward the top of the M range.

**Why it matters:** `connections/dialects.py`'s `build_connect_args` sets
`{"timeout": timeout_seconds}` for MSSQL (pyodbc's `SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT`)
but Postgres gets `SET LOCAL statement_timeout` via a session guardrail —
these are two different mechanisms with different failure modes, and neither
has been verified to actually abort a genuinely long-running query mid-flight
under load (vs. just failing to *start* one). A "server-side execution
timeout" is a core safety claim in the README; it needs a test that proves a
slow query gets killed, not just a config value that's plausibly correct.

**What to do:** Add a test that runs a deliberately slow query (e.g.
`pg_sleep()` on Postgres) against a real database and asserts it's aborted
within roughly `timeout_seconds`, not left running.

### 4. No CI pipeline

**Effort: S (0.5–1 day).** Mostly YAML + iterating until the workflow is
green; the steps themselves (`poetry install`, `black --check`, `pytest`)
already work locally.

**Why it matters:** There is currently no automated gate running `pytest` or
`black --check` on push/PR — every regression depends on someone remembering
to run tests locally, which is nowhere near "production grade."

**What to do:** Add GitHub Actions (or equivalent) running `poetry install`,
`black --check`, and `pytest` on every PR, plus the MSSQL integration suite
from item 2 as a separate (slower) job once it exists. Add a Docker image
build+smoke-test step given `Dockerfile` exists but has never been built in
this session.

## P1 — needed before general availability

### 5. Policy and connections can't be updated without a process restart

**Effort: M (2–3 days).** The reload mechanism itself is small; the real
work is correctness under concurrency — an in-flight request must not see a
half-swapped registry, and engines/sessions tied to a removed or changed
connection need clean teardown, not just dropping the reference.

**Why it matters:** `connections/registry.py` and `policy/loader.py` both
load their YAML file once into a process-wide singleton on first access
(`get_registry()` / `get_policy_store()`). Tightening a policy in response to
an incident, or adding a connection, requires a full redeploy — unacceptable
turnaround time for a security control.

**What to do:** Add a way to reload both stores without downtime — a
SIGHUP handler, an authenticated admin endpoint, or a file-watcher — and
decide what happens to in-flight requests during a reload (should not tear
down active connections using the old registry).

### 6. Per-principal policy doesn't exist — only per-connection

**Effort: L (3–5 days).** Touches the policy model, the loader's merge
logic, `validation/policy_validation.py`, the compiler's
`_apply_mandatory_row_filters`, and both auth layers to thread the principal
through — genuinely cross-cutting, not contained to one module. Do item 8
first; this item is much smaller once `Principal` can carry claims.

**Why it matters:** Every authenticated caller of a given connection gets
identical table/column/row access. There's no way to say "agent A can see
`orders` but not `customers.email`; agent B can see both" on the same
connection. `mandatory_row_filters` is the closest thing to per-tenant
scoping, but its `value` is a static literal in the policy file — it can't
be derived from the authenticated principal (e.g., "scope every query to
`tenant_id = <claim from the caller's JWT>`"), which is the actual shape
most multi-tenant SaaS deployments need.

**What to do:** Extend `Policy` (or add a `PrincipalPolicy` layered on top)
so caps/allow-deny/mandatory filters can vary by `Principal.subject` (or a
richer `Principal` with scopes/claims, see item 8), and make
`mandatory_row_filters.value` support a `from_claim: <name>` indirection
resolved from the authenticated principal at query time, not just a fixed
value.

### 7. Health/readiness checks are fake

**Effort: S (~1 day).** One background task per connection pinging on an
interval, plus wiring the cached result into `/health` — small, self
contained in `api/app.py` + a new module.

**Why it matters:** `GET /health` (`api/app.py`) returns a static
`{"status": "ok"}` regardless of whether any configured database is actually
reachable. A load balancer or orchestrator using this for liveness/readiness
will happily route traffic to an instance that can't reach its databases at
all.

**What to do:** Add a real readiness check that (optionally, since pinging
every connection on every health-check request is wasteful) verifies engine
connectivity — at minimum a cached "last known good" ping per connection,
refreshed on an interval, not synchronously per health-check call.

### 8. `Principal` is just a bearer-token subject string — no scopes/claims

**Effort: S (0.5–1 day).** A dataclass field plus threading it through
`ApiKeyAuthenticator`, `api/auth.py`, `mcp/auth.py`, and `audit_query` calls
— mechanical, low risk. Worth doing early since items 6 and 10 both build on
it.

**Why it matters:** `core/auth.py`'s `Principal` has exactly one field
(`subject`). There's no way to carry roles, scopes, or tenant claims through
to the policy layer, which blocks item 6 (per-principal policy) and any
future RBAC/OAuth work — `Authenticator.authenticate()` would need to return
something richer than a subject string for a JWT-based implementation to be
meaningful.

**What to do:** Extend `Principal` with an extensible claims/scopes field
now, even before a second `Authenticator` implementation exists, so the
interface doesn't need a breaking change later. Thread it through to
`audit_query` (already logs `principal.subject`; extend to log relevant
scopes on rejection for "principal X tried to access denied resource Y").

### 9. Concurrency limiter doesn't work across multiple instances

**Effort: L (3–5 days).** A distributed semaphore/token bucket needs a
backend (Redis is the obvious choice), a client library, failure-mode
handling (what happens when Redis is unreachable — fail open or closed?),
and tests using something like `fakeredis` plus a real-Redis integration
test. The "just document it" alternative is effectively free — the cost is
entirely in choosing to build the distributed version.

**Why it matters:** `execution/concurrency.py`'s `SEMAPHORES` dict is an
in-process `asyncio.Semaphore` per connection id. Run 3 instances behind a
load balancer with `max_concurrency: 8` and the real ceiling against that
database is 24, not 8 — silently defeating the configured guardrail at
exactly the moment it matters (a burst of traffic that triggers
autoscaling).

**What to do:** Either document this loudly as a single-instance-only
guarantee (minimum bar), or replace the in-process semaphore with a
distributed one (Redis-backed token bucket/semaphore is the standard
approach) for deployments that actually run more than one instance.

### 10. No OAuth/JWT — only static API keys

**Effort: M (2–3 days).** JWKS fetching/caching and signature verification
are well-trodden (a library does the crypto), but claims-to-`Principal`
mapping, config surface, and testing against a real or mock identity
provider add up. Faster if item 8 has already landed.

**Why it matters:** `core/auth.py`'s `Authenticator` protocol was
deliberately designed to make this additive, but nothing beyond
`ApiKeyAuthenticator` exists yet. Static bearer tokens don't give you
per-caller identity beyond a single shared subject per key, expiry, or
integration with an existing identity provider — all things enterprise
buyers will ask for.

**What to do:** Implement a `JwtAuthenticator` (verify signature against a
JWKS endpoint, map claims → `Principal`) as a second `Authenticator`,
selectable via config. Should slot in without touching `api/routes.py` or
`mcp/server.py` — if it doesn't, the abstraction has a leak worth fixing
first.

### 11. Result size isn't actually bounded — only row *count* is

**Effort: S (0.5–1 day).** A running byte-size accumulator while shaping
rows in `execution/service.py`, plus a policy field and a truncation/reject
decision — small, self-contained.

**Why it matters:** `Policy.max_limit`/`max_limit_aggregate` cap row count,
but nothing caps row *width*. A table with a large `TEXT`/`JSONB`/`BLOB`
column selected across 100 rows (a permitted, policy-compliant query) could
still return a very large response body — a resource-exhaustion vector the
row cap doesn't address.

**What to do:** Add a response byte-size cap (truncate or reject past a
configurable threshold) in `execution/service.py`'s result shaping, and
decide the failure mode (truncate with a warning flag vs. hard reject).

---

## P2 — hardening and scale

### 12. No metrics/observability beyond structured logs

**Effort: M (2–3 days).** Instrumentation itself is quick per-module, but
it touches several files (concurrency, service, validation) and needs
thought about label cardinality (e.g., don't put raw SQL in a metric label)
and an exporter choice (Prometheus vs. OTel).

**Why it matters:** `core/logging.py` emits JSON lines to stdout, which is
fine for log aggregation but gives no cheap way to alert on "concurrency
saturation is climbing" or "rejection rate spiked" without parsing logs.
Production operators expect Prometheus-style metrics (or OpenTelemetry) for
this class of guardrail.

**What to do:** Add counters/histograms for: queries executed, queries
rejected (by reason: policy/schema/timeout/concurrency), query duration,
per-connection concurrency-slot utilization, and expose via `/metrics` or an
OTel exporter.

### 13. No secrets-manager integration for connection strings

**Effort: M–L (2–4 days).** One backend (e.g. Vault) is the M end; doing it
generically pluggable plus wiring in rotation (which leans on item 5) pushes
toward L. Cleanest if scoped to one backend first rather than a fully
generic abstraction up front.

**Why it matters:** `connections/registry.py`'s `${VAR}` interpolation reads
from `os.environ` only. That's fine for a single-node deployment but doesn't
integrate with Vault/AWS Secrets Manager/GCP Secret Manager rotation flows
that many enterprise deployments require, and offers no rotation story
(a changed secret needs a process restart to pick up, same root cause as
item 5).

**What to do:** Add a pluggable secret-resolution interface alongside env
var interpolation (e.g. `${vault:secret/path#field}`), and combine with the
reload mechanism from item 5 so rotated secrets don't need a restart.

### 14. Docker image has never been built or run in this session

**Effort: S, but volatile (0.5–1 day if it just works; can balloon toward
M–L if the MSSQL ODBC apt-install step has rotted).** Everything else in the
Dockerfile is standard and low-risk; that one step is the entire variance.

**Why it matters:** `Dockerfile` was rewritten off a public base image as
part of the QueryGate migration but was never actually built — the MSSQL
ODBC driver installation step (`msodbcsql18` via Microsoft's apt repo) in
particular is exactly the kind of step that silently rots (URL changes,
package renames, GPG key format changes).

**What to do:** Build the image in CI (see item 4), run the container, and
hit `/health` and `/api/v1/connections` against it as a smoke test.

### 15. No load/soak testing of the concurrency and timeout guardrails

**Effort: M (1–2 days).** Writing the load script is quick; the time sink is
running it against a real database repeatedly and interpreting results
(is a slowdown the guardrail working as intended, or a real bottleneck?).

**Why it matters:** The concurrency semaphore and timeout logic are
unit-tested for correctness in isolation (`tests/unit/test_concurrency.py`)
but never tested under realistic concurrent load against a real database —
which is exactly the scenario these guardrails exist for.

**What to do:** Add a load test (locust/k6/a simple asyncio script) that
fires concurrent requests past `max_concurrency` and confirms the observed
in-flight count against the real database never exceeds the configured cap,
and that rejected/queued requests behave as documented.

### 16. Column-level policy is case-sensitive and untested cross-dialect

**Effort: XS (a few hours).** A normalization pass in `policy/models.py` and
wherever table names are collected during reflection, plus one test with a
mixed-case table name — small and low-risk.

**Why it matters:** `Policy.column_allowed`/`table_allowed`
(`policy/models.py`) lowercase both sides before comparing, but the *keys*
of `allowed_columns`/`denied_columns` dicts are matched by exact table-name
string from the policy YAML — if a table name's casing differs between what
an admin wrote in `policy.yaml` and what the connection's reflection
actually returns (dialect-dependent — Postgres lowercases unquoted
identifiers, MSSQL usually preserves case), a denied-column rule can
silently fail to match.

**What to do:** Normalize table-name casing consistently (probably: always
lowercase when reflecting and when matching policy keys) and add a test
using a mixed-case table name.

### 17. No policy/connections file validation tooling

**Effort: S (0.5–1 day).** Thin wrapper around logic that already exists
(`ConnectionRegistry.from_file`, `PolicyStore.from_file` already raise on
most bad input) — mostly packaging it as a runnable CLI plus the
cross-file id check that doesn't exist yet.

**Why it matters:** A typo in `policy.yaml` or `connections.yaml` (bad YAML,
wrong type, unknown connection id in a policy override) currently only
surfaces as a runtime error the first time something touches the affected
connection — not at deploy time.

**What to do:** Add a small CLI (`querygate validate-config` or similar)
that loads both files, runs full Pydantic validation, and cross-checks that
every `connections:` key in `policy.yaml` corresponds to a real connection
id — runnable in CI/CD before a config change ships.

---

## P3 — future scope (explicitly deferred, not a gap in v1)

### 18. Stored-procedure catalog

**Effort: XL (1–3+ weeks).** This is a new subsystem, not an extension of
an existing one: a catalog/registry model (mirroring `connections/` +
`policy/`'s design), typed parameter validation (no schema-reflection
equivalent exists for procedure signatures), new REST/MCP surface, policy
gating, and a real security review given procedures can have side effects
that structured SELECT queries structurally cannot.

**Why it matters:** The original prototype had a stored-procedure pass-through
(`execute_stored_procedure`) that QueryGate deliberately did not port —
exposing arbitrary stored procedures is a different (and harder) safety
problem than structured SELECT queries: procedures can have side effects,
arbitrary parameter shapes, and no equivalent of schema-reflection-based
validation.

**What to do (when prioritized):** Design an explicit, policy-gated catalog
model — each exposed procedure individually declared (name, typed
parameters, whether it's confirmed read-only) rather than a generic
pass-through, matching the "safe stored procedure/tool catalog pattern"
called out as a goal but intentionally not attempted in v1.

### 19. Additional dialects (MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.)

**Effort: M–XL, per dialect.** MySQL is closest to Postgres/MSSQL's shape
(mature async SQLAlchemy driver, standard `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`) — likely M
(2–3 days). Snowflake/BigQuery are architecturally different (no native
async driver in some cases, different auth models, different SQL dialects
for date functions) and are realistically L–XL each, closer to "add a new
connection type" than "extend an enum."

**Why it matters:** goal 7 scoped this to "Postgres and MSSQL... if
feasible." Broader dialect support is a natural expansion once those two are
production-hardened (items 2–4), but adding a third dialect before the first
two are fully proven would spread verification effort thin.

**What to do (when prioritized):** Extend `connections/dialects.py` and the
compiler's dialect dispatch (currently a 3-way branch in
`_date_bucket_expr`) — the isolation pattern already supports this, it's
additive work, not a redesign.

### 20. Client SDK / agent-framework integration examples

**Effort: S (0.5–1 day) per framework example.** Writing and testing one
working example against LangChain or the Claude Agent SDK is quick; scope
creep risk is adding "just one more" framework rather than the work itself
being hard.

**Why it matters:** `examples/mcp_calls.md` and `examples/rest_calls.md`
show raw JSON-RPC/curl, which is correct but not the fastest path for a
developer wiring QueryGate into LangChain, the Claude Agent SDK, or a custom
tool-calling loop.

**What to do (when prioritized):** Add a thin example (not a maintained SDK
necessarily) showing QueryGate's MCP tools registered in one or two popular
agent frameworks, to shorten time-to-first-query for adopters.
